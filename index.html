            Hi My Name is Prestige! I created this website so people could know
            me better! I also created this website as a sort of reminder of my
            goals and sort of like a timecapsle! I will add all of my personal
            goals here and I will keep a tally of how many I ended up finishing
            them and I will update this counting every month! so stay here with
            me for the long journey!

      <h4>
        And this are all of my Goals with my self at self-improvement,
        Productivity, I plan on finishing all of these by the end of 1-2 months!
        well that is besides Unify which is a Top secret Goal of mine ^^ but I
        can tell you all of the other ones! the first one is Arabic which is a
        Language that I am learning! which contains 12.3 Million Words! and the
        reason to why I am learning arabic is due to the Quran! you see I am
        actually muslim and I am trying to become a hafiz (google it) next up is
        Excercise which is a no-brianers I am a fat boi and I plan on losing
        weight as well as getting thos abs and last but not least Cooking my
        Reasoning for this is actually because of my family as my mother is 50
        years old and the older she gets the harder it is for her to cook,
        unfortunately my siblings don't necessarily have talent for cooking or
        they have tried cooking and I belive that I should be the Cook Of The
        House.

            the quran and additionall 2 hours learning arabic and I have hopes
            of becoming a hafiz in 1-2 years
